# Fish-Species-Detection-and-Recognition

Estimating the relative abundance of fish species in their habitats on a regular basis and keeping an eye on population fluctuations are crucial tasks for marine scientists and conservationists. Diverse automatic computer-based fish sample methods have been demonstrated in underwater photos and videos as alternatives to time-consuming hand sampling. There isn't, however, a perfect method for automatically detecting fish and classifying their species. This is mostly due to the difficulties in producing clear underwater images and videos, which include environmental fluctuations in lighting, fish camouflage, dynamic backdrops, murky water, low resolution, shape deformations of moving fish, and tiny variances between some fish species.
